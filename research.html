Different websites have their own content to make their website attractive and prefect. From the view of content and fonts the website becomes perfect.
As I compare my website with other website then my website is quite simple with less pages and less functionality.Home page of my website is similar to shown website.I had took idea to display navigation bar at the left side of the web page.And the furthermore thing that i had implemented is the hover effect which made my navigation bar more attractive.Display time at the top of the website is possible because of javascript, css an d Html. HTML and css play a vital roles to implement my ideas and javacrcipt too.<a href="https://codepen.io/trhino/full/ujHan/">Link of website which i had took as reference</a>
